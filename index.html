    <h1> JS </h1>
    <P>JavaScript is a single-threaded, synchronous programming and scripting language widely used in web development. It plays a crucial role in both front-end and back-end development, enabling dynamic and interactive user experiences. Unlike compiled languages, JavaScript is interpreted through web browsers, making it highly accessible and versatile. It is a loosely typed (or weakly typed) language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. </P>
